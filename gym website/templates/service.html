      we best cardio system and mechines to train you harder and loss your fats and carb.
      Cardio exercise is any exercise that raises your heart rate.
      Your heart is a muscle. Therefore working it makes it stronger.
      A stronger cardio-vascular system means more capillaries
      delivering more oxygen to cells in your muscles. This enables
      your cells to burn more fat during both exercise and inactivity.
      Cardio exercise uses large muscle movement over a sustained
      period of time keeping your heart rate to at least 50% of its
      maximum level.
      <p>
        Some of the Best Cardio Workouts Are:

        <p> 1:-Walking – This is the easiest and safest way to start getting in your cardio.</p>

        <p>2:- Elliptical – Minimal impact on the knees and hips but calorie burning is still high.
          When you increase the incline you will activate more muscles.</p>

        <p>3:- Running – This one is easy to understand. Just remember if you train like a
          distance runner you will look like a distance runner. If you train like a sprinter you
          will develop a sprinters body. Steading running burns calories but sprints take it to
          the next level.</p>

      A steam room is a heated room that people use for relaxation
      and to relieve some medical conditions. They are often found
      in gyms or spas. A steam room is created when a water-filled
      generator pumps steam into an enclosed space so there is moisture
      in the air when people are sitting in it.
      <p>Benefits of Yoga...</p>
      <p>There are several health benefits associated with a steam room,
        each of which is described here.
        Improves circulation

        Sitting in a steam room has been shown to have beneficial effects
        on the cardiovascular system, particularly in older people.

        Workout recovery

        Often, after a workout, a person's muscles will feel sore. This pain
        is known as delayed onset muscle soreness, and it is important to relax
        the muscles to promote a quick and healthy recovery.</p>
      <p>Burn calories:- When a person is inside a steam room their heart rate increases. If the
        use a steam room after exercise, then their elevated heart rate can be
        prolonged.

        Experts have found that when used alongside a healthy exercise program,
        the heat generated by the steam room and the sweating it causes can stimulate
        the body and increase wellness.

        It is worth noting that there is no scientific evidence to support the belief
        that using a steam room aids weight loss.</p>
